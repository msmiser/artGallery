Make sure you have your tools!

1. You will need to have downloaded Node https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (you probably have done this)
2. You will need to download Mongobd https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html
3. Download Robo3T https://robomongo.org/
4. Open Terminal (or iTerm) and run the command "mongod." If it is automatically disconnecting you probably haven't typed in your password. Return to documentation on step 2.
5. Open a different terminaltab in the terminal (cmd+T)
6. Open Robo 3T and Create Connection. This will not work if mongod is not running successfully
