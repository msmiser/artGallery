    "name":"cezanne",
    "displayName":"Paul Cézanne",
    "description":"Cézanne was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th-century conception of artistic endeavor to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century. Cézanne's often repetitive, exploratory brushstrokes are highly characteristic and clearly recognizable. He used planes of colour and small brushstrokes that build up to form complex fields. The paintings convey Cézanne's intense study of his subjects."

    "displayName":"Jackson Pollock",
    "description":"A leading French Post-Impressionist, Paul Cezanne bridged the way from 19th century Impressionism to a revolutionary new world of 20th century Cubism. Both Matisse and Picasso are quoted saying Cezanne was “the father of us all.” Although his radical departures were underappreciated and even ridiculed in his time, Cezanne’s studies of visual perception, geometric simplification, and experimentation with complex fractured forms kept his style changing significantly over his lifetime. Cezanne was an eccentric, solitary enigma, often working in isolation, removed even from his own family."

    "displayName":"Del Ventos",
    "description":"From the artist: 'My work explores the relationship between gender politics and daytime TV. With influences as diverse as Wittgenstein and Andy Warhol, new insights are created from both explicit and implicit layers. Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I have been fascinated by the theoretical limits of relationships. What starts out as triumph soon becomes corrupted into a tragedy of greed, leaving only a sense of decadence and the unlikelihood of a new reality. As intermittent derivatives become transformed through studious and critical practice, the viewer is left with an epitaph for the possibilities of our existence."
